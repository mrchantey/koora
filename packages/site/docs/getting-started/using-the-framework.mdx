# Using the Framework


In an ideal world Koora would be provided as some kind of wasm `.dll` file. Because AssemblyScript has a browser-based compiler we could very easily write live demos, compiling only what we need to.

Currently working with Koora requires building the AssemblyScript locally. Below is a CodeSandbox demonstrating how the library can be used. Note that this is a `container` sandbox, because we need to use `node` to generate the wasm.

:::tip
to play with this sandbox:
1. if it isn't already running, start the server `npm run start`
2. in another terminal window, start listening for AssemblyScript changes: `npm run aswatch`
3. make some changes to `src-as/index.ts` and see your changes!

Note: CodeSandbox has about a 10 second delay when compiling, ideally this is all done locally
