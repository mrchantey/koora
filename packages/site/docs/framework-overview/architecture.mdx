# Architecture

A Koora scene is made up of entities, each of which has multiple components. Probably the most common component is the `Transform`, which contains positions, rotations, matrices etc. 

## Entities

An entity on its own can simply add, get and remove components.
```ts
const entity = world.createEntity()
```

## Components

Components can be used to store data and hold behaviors.
```ts
entity.add<Rotator>()
```

## Systems

A System will operate on arrays of entities and their components.

```ts
world.addSystem<RotatorSystem>()
```
