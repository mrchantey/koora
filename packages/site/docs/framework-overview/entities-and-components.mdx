# Entities and Components


A Koora scene is made up of entities, each of which has multiple components. Probably the most common component is the `Transform`, which contains positions, rotations, matrices etc. 

## Entities

An entity on its own can simply add, get and remove components.


## Components

Components can be used to store data and hold behaviors.
