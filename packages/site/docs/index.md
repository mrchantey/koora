# Introduction

Koora enables the creation of 3D games with AssemblyScript.

:::info Is Koora for me?
This library is highly experimental, and ongoing maintenance is not guaranteed. If you're motivations are to actually produce a web-based game, battle-hardened libraries like [three](https://threejs.org) and [babylon](https://babylonjs.com) will run circles around Koora in every way.

Otherwise, if you are interested in experimenting with game dev in AssemblyScript, read on intrepid adventurer! ðŸ¥³

## Overview

The framework prioritizes modularity through an Entity-Component-System style architecture:

```ts

const world = new World()
	.addSystem<TransformSystem>()
	.addSystem<HealthSystem>()
	.addSystem<InputSystem>()

const player = world.createEntity()
	.add<Transform>()
	.add<Health>()
	.add<Camera>()
	.add<KeyboardController>()

const enemy = world.createEntity()
	.add<Transform>()
	.add<Health>()
	.add<AIController>()
```
